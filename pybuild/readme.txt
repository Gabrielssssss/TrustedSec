Download pyinstaller from here: http://www.pyinstaller.org/

Unzip pyinstaller to your Desktop or something. Note pyinstaller works on all operating systems, so if you need to compile a Linux
python script, make sure you unzip on the Linux machine to compile on there...

Move pybuild.py to the pyinstaller folder that you just unzipped. If you didn't unzip and you're reading this..Stop skipping ahead =)

Move the python script you want to compile to the root of the pyinstaller folder.

Double click pybuild.py, enter the name of the python script…for example hugs.py… When it compiles, you will have a hugs folder, go into the
dist folder and your executable will be there.
